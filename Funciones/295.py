# in the problem of the students and the notes it is requesd:
# 1) Desing a procedure that receives two lists and displays
# on the screen the names of all the students who passed
# the exam.
#
# 2)desing a function that receives the list of grades and returns
# the number of passes.
#
# 3) desing a procedure that receives two lists and display on the
# screen the name of all the students who obtained the maximun mark
#
# 4) desing a procedure that reveives the two lists and displays on
# the screen the name of all students whose grade is equal to or higher
# than the average grade
#
# 5) desing a function that reveives the two lists and a name (a string);
# if the name is in the student list, it will return your grade, if not
# it will return None.
