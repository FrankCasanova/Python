# we have the times of each cyclist and stage
# for the participants in the last local
# cycle tour. The cyclists lists contains a
# series of names. The matrix has a row for
# each cyclist, in the same order that they
# appear in cyclists. Each row has the time
# in secods (a floating value) invested
# in each of the 5 stages of the race.
#
# is requested:
#
# a function that receives the list and the
# matrix and returns the winner of the round,
# the one whose sum of times in the stages
# is minimal
#
# a function that receives the list and array
# and a stage number and returns the name
# of the stage winner
#
# a prcedure that receives the list
# and the matrix and shows the winner of each
# stage on the screen.
